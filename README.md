# Chief_Curator_Griffin

The name of this project is called 'Chief Curator Griffin' which is inspired by the science fiction novel, the Invisible Man, written by H. G. Wells. After I finished my job in Carlo Ratti Associati as an Assistant Curator, the idea of 'invisible', 'transparent' and 'sensing' flashed into my mind. Therefore, I created this project with my skill on Deep Learning, by combining curatorship and Artificial Intelligence together.

            The day when I came up this idea.
